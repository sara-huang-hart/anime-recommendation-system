# ðŸ“Œ Project Background  
Over the past few decades, Japanese animation, also known as anime, has successfully emerged as one of the most influential and rapidly growing entertainment industries globally. This global phenomenon has captivated audiences of all ages and backgrounds from classics like <i>One Piece</i> and <i>Naruto</i> to newcomers like <i>Attack on Titan</i> and <i>Jujutsu Kaisen</i>. Anime is growing from streaming platforms, gaming, merchandise, live-action films, and conventions. This remarkable growth has led to a surge of online communities dedicated to this art form.  

This project focused on analyzing data on anime and viewer preferences to create a recommendation system for viewers. We used data from MyAnimeList (MAL), one of the largest anime community-driven platforms that allows users to track, rate, and review anime and manga titles. There are anime-related datasets on Kaggle. However, most of those datasets have not been updated for over 5 years. So for this project, we retrieved the data by using the MyAnimeList API to ensure that we have a more current and comprehensive perspective of our analysis, accounting for the latest developments within the anime community.

# âš¡Data Retrieval  
Our strategy was to first extract the data of users and animes from MyAnimeList and store the data in a data frame that contained a list of the animes and the average user ratings.  
1. Each team member created an account on MAL and obtained a unique client ID to use the OAuth 2.0 protocol to authenticate tokens and access the data.

   <br>  
3. Using the same Python code, each team member was allocated a segment of 10,000 anime IDs.  
   Throughout the process, the API encountered 403 and 404 errors. A 403 error occurs when calls are made too frequently. To mitigate this issue, we added a 3-second delay in the code enabling us to circumvent encountering this problem. A 404 error is a "not found" error. For this issue, we added a conditional statement to skip the anime ID.

   <br>  
5. Each member exported his/her data to a CSV file and placed it into a shared file. All the individual files were consolidated to create a master file that contained approximately 50,000 anime titles and their user rating. Below is an example of what the anime data file looked like.

Since our project objective is to make anime recommendations based on users' ratings, our next task was to generate a user list. The MAL website contains 14 million users. However, using this list would result in excessive time consumption and storage requirements. Therefore, we made the strategic decision to employ a subset of these users, specifically the most recently active users. We utilized the BeautifulSoup library to navigate and extract information from the website.  
1. Each team member ran the code below, which used the provided URL to repeatedly generate a random list of 20 recent users upon each page refresh until a list of 50,000 unique usernames is retrieved.

   <br>  
      <img src="Images/img-07.png" width="800">
   <br>  
   By using the BeautifulSoup library, we were able to parse through the HTML content, targeting the sections where usernames were listed within the HTML structure. This process allowed us to collect as many usernames as required.  
2. Similar to the list of animes, each member exported his/her data to a CSV file and placed it into a shared file. All the individual files were consolidated to create a master file. Duplicate usernames were removed which resulted in approximately 70,000 unique users. Below is an example of what the users' data file looked like.

   <br>
   
With the two lists, one of the anime titles and one of the usernames, we used this data in conjunction with the MAL API to extract user ratings.  
1. Initialized a data frame to store the records, and import the CSV file of the usernames.

   <br>  
      <br>
      <img src="Images/img-10.png" width="800">
   <br>  
3. Executed a loop to iterate through each of the usernames. Then, used the API to call on the rating lists for each user. This resulted in ratings by a total of 18,145 users. Below is an example of what the anime user ratings data file looked like.

# ðŸ§½ Data Cleaning  
Extensive cleaning was undertaken before implementing our model to enhance the quality of our datasets.  
- Due to the size of the dataset, we had to process the initial data in subsets.
- We formatted the columns by removing the brackets and quotations that were included in the raw data.
- We replaced spaces with an underscore (_) to ensure readability.  
- We dropped duplicate rows and any missing values from our data.
- We created dummy variables for the studios and genre variables.
